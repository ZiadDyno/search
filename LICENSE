UC Berkeley CS188 Pacman Project License and Attribution

This repository bundles the UC Berkeley CS188 Pacman framework. I do not own the game or its assets; my work is limited to implementing and documenting search algorithms on top of the Berkeley code.

The Pacman AI projects were developed at UC Berkeley. The core projects and autograders were primarily created by John DeNero and Dan Klein. Student-side autograding was added by Brad Miller, Nick Hay, and Pieter Abbeel. My changes are limited to search-related implementations and documentation.
